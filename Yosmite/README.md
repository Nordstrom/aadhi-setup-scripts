Prerequisites of installing aadhi:
          
__Step 1:__ Install rbenv and rbenv-gemset using the below command

          brew install rbenv
          brew install ruby-buld
          brew install rbenv-gemset
           
__Step 2:__ Run the below command to add rbenv to $PATH

          echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
          echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
          
__Step 3:__ reload bash profile

           . ~/.bash_profile 
           
(dot space ~/profile)

__Step 4:__ Install latest ruby version using rbenv. The below command will take around 5mins to install the specified ruby version

            rbenv install 2.3.1
            
__Step 5:__ Set the global version of Ruby to be used in all shells by writing the version name to the ~/.rbenv/version file. This version can be overridden by an application-specific .ruby-version file, or by setting the RBENV_VERSION environment variable.

            rbenv global 2.3.1
